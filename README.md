## Installation

### Prerequisites
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install tkinter requests pyttsx3 pyautogui psutil SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```

### For Windows users with pyaudio issues:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

## Configuration

### API Setup
Update your Groq API credentials in the script:

```python
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
GROQ_MODEL = "llama3-8b-8192"
```

### Getting a Groq API Key
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Replace the placeholder in the code

## Usage

### Starting the Application
1. Save the code as `nora.py`
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python nora.py
   ```
3. The GUI will launch with NORA ready to assist

## Technical Architecture

### Voice Processing Pipeline
1. Microphone input capture
2. Ambient noise adjustment
3. Google Speech API recognition
4. Command processing and routing
5. Response generation and speech synthesis

### Command Routing System
1. Local command pattern matching
2. System-level command execution
3. Groq API fallback for unknown queries
4. Response formatting and display

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API timeouts
- Voice recognition error recovery
- System command failure reporting
- Network connectivity issues management

## Customization

### Adding New Commands
Extend the `execute_command` method with new command patterns:

```python
elif "your command" in command:
    try:
        # Your command logic here
        return "Command executed successfully"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

### Modifying UI Theme
Update colors and fonts in the `setup_ui` method:
- Background colors: `bg="#000000"`
- Text colors: `fg="#00ffe0"`
- Fonts: `font=("Orbitron", 26)`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Microphone not working: Check system permissions and default audio device
- Commands not recognized: Ensure clear speech and proper microphone setup
- API errors: Verify Groq API key and internet connection
- Application launch failures: Check if target applications are installed

### Performance Tips
- Use specific command phrases for better recognition
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace for voice input
- Keep the GUI responsive by avoiding blocking operations
- Monitor system resources for optimal performance

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely (consider environment variables)
- Be cautious with system command execution
- Validate user input for security
- Consider rate limiting for API calls
